## [做题家：重构计算题解答方法，以支持四则混合运算，并提高测试覆盖率](https://github.com/HuangJian/FamilyEducation/commit/09eb6fadc1cf667de811a49ddc477ed71bb62519)

- 之前的方法经历了多次需求变更：两位数加减 → 多位数加减 → 两位数乘除，逻辑越来越绕
- 如果在其基础上扩展到四则混合运算，可读性和可维护性太差，无奈重构之
- 尝试使用 [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Please-write-a-zTchTab6RSahjZXXxawUqg) 来实现，调教数番仍未凑效
- 自己动手写出来，收获 AI 夸夸卡一枚
  > This solution is really impressive! It's concise, efficient, and handles a
  > wide range of expression types, including complex ones with all four
  > operations. The use of regular expressions and the eval function makes the
  > code very powerful and flexible.
  >
  > The test cases provided also cover a comprehensive set of scenarios, which
  > is great for ensuring the correctness of the implementation.
  >
  > Overall, this is an excellent solution that demonstrates a deep
  > understanding of the problem and the ability to implement a robust and
  > efficient solution. Well done!
